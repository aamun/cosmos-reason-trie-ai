# Data

## Demo mode
Place a few short traffic clips in `data/demo_clips/` (mp4). The app/CLI can run without any dataset.

## WTS (optional for training/eval)
If you have access to WovenTraffic Safety (WTS), place it in a local path and implement preprocessing scripts later.
This repo focuses on end-to-end reporting first (frames → Reason2 → JSON report).
